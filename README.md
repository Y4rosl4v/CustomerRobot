Разработка ПО для мобильного робота-манипулятора с техническим зрением в задаче комплектации заказа для продуктового магазина

The robot manipulator consists of three main components that are interconnected: 
* The manipulator itself, which is the collaborative robot manipulator. 
* The control unit, which is the robot's controller and is necessary for controlling the robot.
* The control panel, which is the robot's control device.

As part of our task, we need to develop software that will allow us to use the robot to collect orders at a grocery store. We need to organize the correct movement through the points, scan the QR code of the product, and capture it if it matches the order list.

### Based on this, we will divide the project into several main tasks:
1. Getting to know the robot and learning how to control it.
2. Developing a component for moving through points.
3. Developing a component for capturing an object (product).
4. Developing a component for using a camera and scanning a product's QR code.
5. Demonstrating the finished product.

### Getting to know the robot and learning how to control it:
We got to know the robot using the TMflow program, which has all the features available to the robot and a user-friendly interface for controlling it. As part of our getting to know the robot, we studied the basic documentation for the robot and the presentations attached in the file. We learned how to control the robot and perform basic tasks related to movement, grasping, and manipulation.
